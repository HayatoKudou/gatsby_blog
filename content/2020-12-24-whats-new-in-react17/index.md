On 20th October the new version of React was released which was a major release for ReactJS after two long years. But surprisingly there were no major developer features that were introduced in this release, rather features related to backward compatibility were introduced to make it easier to upgrade React.

## Why no new features in React 17 ?

The new version of React doesn't add any new developer features to it rather it focuses on adding backward compatibility with old versions of react. React 17 will serve as the bridge between the older and upcoming versions of ReactJS. The team is working on the new features like concurrent mode but they are not a part of this release.

React 17 allows multiple versions of React to be embedded inside the DOM tree. This is one of the major benifits of React 17.

## Gradual React Upgrades

With React 17 you can do gradual React updates. You can update the entire app from the older version to the new version completely or part by part.

React 17 provides two options to upgrade your app to the next version of React, say React 18. Either you can upgrade your entire app at once or migrate your app piece by piece.
